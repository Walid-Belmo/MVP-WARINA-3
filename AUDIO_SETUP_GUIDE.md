## 🎮 How to Use

The music will **automatically start** when you open `index_new.html`.

### Control Music in Browser Console

Open browser console (F12) and type:

```javascript
// Pause music
window.audioManager.pause();

// Resume music
window.audioManager.resume();

// Stop music completely
window.audioManager.stop();

// Toggle music on/off
window.audioManager.toggle();

// Change volume (0.0 to 1.0)
window.audioManager.setVolume(0.5);

// Check if playing
window.audioManager.isPlaying();

// Get full status
window.audioManager.getStatus();
```

## ⚙️ How to Modify Settings

### Change the Music File Name

If you want to use a different filename, edit `js/ui/audioManager.js` line 11:

```javascript
this.MUSIC_FILE = 'music/background.mp3';  // Change this
```

Example:
```javascript
this.MUSIC_FILE = 'music/my-awesome-song.mp3';
```

### Change the Default Volume

Edit `js/ui/audioManager.js` line 12:

```javascript
this.DEFAULT_VOLUME = 0.3;  // 0.0 = silent, 1.0 = full volume
```

Example for louder music:
```javascript
this.DEFAULT_VOLUME = 0.6;  // 60% volume
```

### Stop Music from Auto-Playing

If you don't want music to start automatically, edit `js/app.js` around line 68-71 and remove or comment out:

```javascript
// Start background music after a short delay (allows user interaction)
setTimeout(() => {
    window.audioManager.play();
}, 500);
```

## 📝 Code Structure

### Simple and Clear Architecture

The audio manager is intentionally kept simple:

- **One file**: `js/ui/audioManager.js` (only ~200 lines)
- **One music track**: Plays continuously in a loop
- **Easy configuration**: All settings at the top of the file
- **Automatic save**: Volume and on/off preference saved in browser

### Key Features

✅ Continuous looping background music  
✅ Volume control (adjustable)  
✅ Toggle on/off (with persistence)  
✅ Error handling (won't crash if file missing)  
✅ Browser autoplay handling (works around browser restrictions)  
✅ Settings saved in localStorage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Music Doesn't Play

1. **Check file exists**: Make sure `background.mp3` is in the `music/` folder
2. **Check console**: Press F12 and look for error messages
3. **Click the page**: Some browsers block autoplay - click anywhere on the page
4. **Check volume**: Type `window.audioManager.getStatus()` in console

### Music is Too Loud/Quiet

```javascript
// In browser console
window.audioManager.setVolume(0.2);  // Quieter
window.audioManager.setVolume(0.8);  // Louder
```

Or edit `DEFAULT_VOLUME` in `js/ui/audioManager.js`

### Want Different Music for Different Scenes?
